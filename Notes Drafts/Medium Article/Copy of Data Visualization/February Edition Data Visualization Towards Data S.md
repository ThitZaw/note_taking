Data visualization is an essential step in any data science process. It’s the final bridge between the data scientist and end users. It communicates, validates, confronts and educates. And when done correctly, it opens up the insights from a data science project to a wider audience.

Great data visualization is more than painting a pretty picture with numbers. In fact, that’s often only a small part of it. We also need to consider other factors such as the type of audience seeing the visuals, the level of data literacy, the need for interactivity and the overall story that multiple graphs are telling.

These 8 articles make up our top picks for posts that provide helpful tools for data visualization, new insights on where the practice is headed, and interesting examples on how charts can be used effectively to tell a story.
