A year ago, I dropped out of one of the best computer science programs in Canada. I started creating my own [data science master’s program](https://medium.com/@davidventuri/i-dropped-out-of-school-to-create-my-own-data-science-master-s-here-s-my-curriculum-1b400dcee412) using online resources. I realized that I could learn everything I needed through edX, Coursera, and Udacity instead. And I could learn it faster, more efficiently, and for a fraction of the cost.

I’m almost finished now. I’ve taken many data science-related courses and audited portions of many more. I know the options out there, and what skills are needed for learners preparing for a data analyst or data scientist role. **A few months ago, I started creating a review-driven guide that recommends the best courses for each subject within data science.**

For the first guide in the series, I recommended a few [coding classes](https://medium.freecodecamp.com/if-you-want-to-learn-data-science-start-with-one-of-these-programming-classes-fb694ffe780c#.42hhzxopw) for the beginner data scientist. Then it was [statistics and probability classes](https://medium.freecodecamp.com/if-you-want-to-learn-data-science-take-a-few-of-these-statistics-classes-9bbabab098b9#.p7pac546r). Then it was [intros to data science](https://medium.freecodecamp.com/i-ranked-all-the-best-data-science-intro-courses-based-on-thousands-of-data-points-db5dc7e3eb8e#.5qdvv8dui) itself.

For this guide, I spent 10+ hours trying to identify every online data visualization course offered as of March 2017, extracting key bits of information from their syllabi and reviews, and compiling their ratings. For this task, I turned to none other than the open source Class Central community and its database of thousands of course ratings and reviews.

Since 2011, [Class Central](https://www.class-central.com/) founder [Dhawal Shah](https://www.class-central.com/@dhawal) has kept a closer eye on online courses than arguably anyone else in the world. Dhawal personally helped me assemble this list of resources.

# How we picked courses to consider

Each course must fit three criteria:

1. **The majority of the course must be focused on *explanatory* data visualization.** Coverage of data preparation, for example, is permitted given it is an important part of the data visualization process. Courses that cover less relevant topics (statistical modeling, for example) are excluded. More on the *explanatory* distinction below.
2. **It must be on-demand or offered every few months.**
3. **It must be an interactive online course, so no books or read-only tutorials**. Though these are viable ways to learn, this guide focuses on courses.

We believe we covered every notable course that fits the above criteria. Since there are seemingly hundreds of courses on [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/), we chose to consider the most-reviewed and highest-rated ones only. There’s always a chance that we missed something, though, so please let us know in the comments section if we left a good course out.

We compiled average rating and number of reviews from Class Central and other review sites to calculate a weighted average rating for each course. We read text reviews and used this feedback to supplement the numerical ratings.

We made subjective syllabus judgment calls based on **two** factors, with the first given preference over the second:

1. **Coverage of data visualization theory.** Are the motivations for visualization choices explained? Does the course only teach the tool? More on this in the next section.
2. **Coverage of chosen data visualization tool(s).** Does the course effectively teach common visualization tools (Tableau, ggplot2, Seaborn, etc.)? Do students have opportunities to practice these skills? No preference for tool choice is given.
