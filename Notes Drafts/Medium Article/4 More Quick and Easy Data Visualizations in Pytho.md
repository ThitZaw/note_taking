Data Visualization is a big part of any data science or machine learning project. You’ll often start out with an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to gain some insights into your data and creating visualizations really helps make things clearer and easier to understand, especially with larger, high dimensional datasets. Towards the end of your project, it’s important to be able to present your final results in a clear, concise, and compelling manner that your audience, whom are often non-technical clients, can understand.

You may have seen my previous article *[5 Quick and Easy Data Visualizations in Python with Code](https://towardsdatascience.com/5-quick-and-easy-data-visualizations-in-python-with-code-a2284bae952f)* where we went through 5 basic visualizations: scatter plots, line plots, histograms, bar plots, and box plots. Those were simple yet powerful visualisations that you can definitely use to extract great insight from your datasets. In this post we’re going to see 4 *more* data visualizations! These ones will be a little bit more elaborate and can be used after you’ve gone through the basic ones from the last post to extract even deeper information from your data.

A heat map is a matrix representation of data where each matrix value is represented as a colour. The different colours represent different magnitudes and the matrix indices link together the 2 items or features being compared. Heat maps are great for showing the relationships between multiple feature variables since you can directly see the magnitude as a colour. You can also see how each relationship compares to the other relationships in your dataset by looking at the other points in the heat map. The colour is really what provides the easy interpretation since it is so intuitive.

Now for the code. The `seaborn` library can be used for more advanced plots than matplotlib, usually things that require more components like many colours, graphics, or variables. `matplotlib` is used for displaying the plot, `numpy` for generating the data, and `pandas` for handling it! The plotting is just one simple seaborn function where we can also set the colour mapping if you find something particularly visually pleasing.

A 2D density plot is a simple extension of the 1D version with the added benefit of being able to see the probability distribution with respect to 2 variables. Let’s checkout the 2D density plot below. The legend on the right uses *colour* to represent the probability at each point. The highest probability, and therefore concentration of our data, seems to be around a size of 0.5 and a speed of 1.4-ish. As you can tell by now, 2D density plots are great for quickly identifying where our data is most concentrated with respect to *two variables,* rather than just one as in the 1D density plot. This is especially powerful when you have two variables that are very important to your output and want to see how they both contribute *together* to the output distribution.

The code is again super simple with seaborn! This time we’ll create a skewed distribution to make things interesting. Most of the optional arguments are there to make things look more clear if you find certain colours and / or shading more visually pleasing.

A spider plot is one of the best ways to display a one-to-many relationship. I.e you can plot and see the values of several variables with respect to a single variable or category. The prominence of one variable over another is clear and obvious in a spider plot since the area and length is made larger in that specific direction. If you want to see how several categories stack up with respect to those variables, you can plot them side by side. In the diagram below, it’s easy to compare the different attributes of the avengers and see where each of their strengths lie! (Note that these stats were set pretty randomly, I wasn’t biased to any of the Avengers ;) )
