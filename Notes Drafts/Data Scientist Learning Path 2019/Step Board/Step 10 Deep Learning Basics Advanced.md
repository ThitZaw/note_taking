# Step : 10 Deep Learning Basics & Advanced

Status: Not Started

### Deep Learning Basics (May 2017 — June 2017)

**Course (mandatory)**

- [Machine Learning by Andrew Ng](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning) — There is no better introductory material to Deep Learning and Neural Networks than Week 4 and Week 5 material of this course.
- [Deep learning by Google | Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/course/deep-learning--ud730) — This is an excellent basic course on transition from Machine Learning to Deep Learning, deep neural networks, Convolutional Neural Networks
and Deep Learning for texts.

**Reading Material/Books**

- [Deep learning Textbook](http://www.deeplearningbook.org/) — Written by people like Ian Goodfellow, Yoshua Bengio and Aaron
Courville, this book is bound to become the de-facto for people trying
to learn Deep Learning.
- [Stanford Deep Learning tutorial](http://deeplearning.stanford.edu/tutorial/) — This is an all text and images resource provided by Stanford which
starts from Linear Regression and goes to Convolutional Neural Networks
with ease.

**Practice** — [Identify the digits](https://datahack.analyticsvidhya.com/contest/practice-problem-identify-the-digits/) — An awesome contest to check the basics you have learned to identify handwritten digits.

## Deep Learning advanced (June 2017 — August 2017)

**Course (mandatory)**

- [Deep Learning by Oxford](https://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/people/nando.defreitas/machinelearning/)
- [Deep learning summer school at Montreal 2016](http://videolectures.net/deeplearning2016_montreal/) — This is a treasure trove of knowledge with many experts researching
in the field of Deep Learning delivering keynote lectures.
