# Step : 8 Profile Building on Github and Participation in Competition

Status: Not Started

It is very important for a Data Scientist to have a GitHub profile to host all the codes of the project he/she has undertaken. Potential employers not only see what you have done, how you have coded and how frequently / how long you have been practicing data science.

Also, codes on GitHub open up avenues for open source projects which can
highly boost your learning. If you donâ€™t know how to use Git, you can
learn from [Git and GitHub](https://www.udacity.com/course/how-to-use-git-and-github--ud775) on Udacity. This is one of the best and easy to learn course to manage the repositories through terminal.
