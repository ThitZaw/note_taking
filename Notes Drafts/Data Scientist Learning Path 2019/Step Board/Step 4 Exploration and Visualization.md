Status: Not Started

- 1. R Programming
    - **Course**
        - [Exploratory Data Analysis](https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2016/01/complete-tutorial-learn-data-science-python-scratch-2/) — This is an awesome course by Johns Hopkins University on Coursera.
        You will need no other course to perform visualization and exploratory
        work in R.
    - **Blogs/Articles**
        - [Cheat sheet — Data Exploration in R](https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2015/10/cheatsheet-11-steps-data-exploration-with-codes/) — This cheat sheet contains all the steps in data exploration with
        codes. I suggest you to take out a print and paste it on your wall for
        quick reference.
        - [Comprehensive guide to Data Exploration in R](https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2015/04/comprehensive-guide-data-exploration-r/) — This will be a one-stop article that I will suggest you to go through carefully and follow every step. This is because the steps mentioned in the article are the same steps you will be using while solving any data problem or a hackathon problem.
- 2. Python
    - **Course (optional)**
        - [Intro to Data Analysis](https://www.udacity.com/course/intro-to-data-analysis--ud170) — This is an excellent course by Udacity on Data Exploration using Numpy and Pandas.
