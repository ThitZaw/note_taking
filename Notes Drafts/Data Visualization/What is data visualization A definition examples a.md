# What is data visualization? A definition, examples, and resources

[https://www.tableau.com/learn/articles/data-visualization](https://www.tableau.com/learn/articles/data-visualization)

Data visualization is the graphical representation of information and data. By using [visual elements like charts, graphs, and maps](https://www.tableau.com/learn/articles/data-visualization/glossary), data visualization tools provide an accessible way to see and understand trends, outliers, and patterns in data.

In the world of Big Data, data visualization tools and technologies are essential to analyze massive amounts of information and make data-driven decisions.

## The advantages and benefits of good data visualization

![What%20is%20data%20visualization%20A%20definition%20examples%20a/_data_visualization_definition.gif](What%20is%20data%20visualization%20A%20definition%20examples%20a/_data_visualization_definition.gif)

Our eyes are [drawn to colors and patterns](https://www.tableau.com/learn/whitepapers/tableau-visual-guidebook). We can quickly identify red from blue, square from circle. Our culture is visual, including everything from art and advertisements to TV and movies.

Data visualization is another form of visual art that grabs our interest and keeps our eyes on the message. When we see a chart, we [quickly see trends and outliers](https://www.tableau.com/reports/business-intelligence-trends). If we can see something, we internalize it quickly. It’s storytelling with a purpose. If you’ve ever stared at a massive spreadsheet of data and couldn’t see a trend, you know how much more effective a visualization can be.

### Big Data is here and we need to know what it says

As the [“age of Big Data” kicks into high-gear](https://www.economist.com/news/leaders/21721656-data-economy-demands-new-approach-antitrust-rules-worlds-most-valuable-resource), visualization is an increasingly key tool to make sense of the trillions of rows of data generated every day. Data visualization helps to tell stories by curating data into a form easier to understand, highlighting the trends and outliers. A good visualization tells a story, removing the noise from data and highlighting the useful information.

However, it’s not simply as easy as just dressing up a graph to make it look better or slapping on the “info” part of an infographic. Effective data visualization is a delicate balancing act between form and function. The plainest graph could be too boring to catch any notice or it make tell a powerful point; the most stunning visualization could utterly fail at conveying the right message or it could speak volumes. The data and the visuals need to work together, and there’s an art to combining great analysis with great storytelling.

### Why data visualization is important for any career

It’s hard to think of a professional industry that doesn’t benefit from [making data more understandable](https://www.forbes.com/sites/jeffkauflin/2017/07/20/the-five-most-in-demand-skills-for-data-analysis-jobs/#3e300312c7ce). Every STEM field benefits from understanding data—and so do fields in government, finance, marketing, history, consumer goods, service industries, education, sports, and so on.

While we’ll always wax poetically about data visualization (you’re on the Tableau website, after all) there are practical, real-life applications that are undeniable. And, since visualization is so prolific, it’s also one of the most useful professional skills to develop. The better you can convey your points visually, whether in a dashboard or a slide deck, the better you can leverage that information.

The concept of [the citizen data scientist is on the rise](https://www.gartner.com/newsroom/id/3570917). Skill sets are changing to accommodate a data-driven world. It is increasingly valuable for professionals to be able to use data to make decisions and use visuals to tell stories of when data informs the who, what, when, where, and how. While traditional education typically draws a distinct line between creative storytelling and technical analysis, the modern professional world also values those who can cross between the two: data visualization sits right in the middle of analysis and visual storytelling.

## Examples of data visualization in action

When you think of data visualization, your first thought probably immediately goes to simple bar graphs or pie charts. While these may be an integral part of visualizing data and a common baseline for many data graphics, the right visualization must be paired with the right set of information. [Simple graphs are only the tip of the iceberg](https://www.tableau.com/learn/whitepapers/which-chart-or-graph-is-right-for-you). There’s a whole selection of visualization methods to present data in effective and interesting ways.
