# Top 25 Computer Vision Project Ideas for 2020 - DataFlair

**Computer Vision Projects**

Computer vision is the most powerful and compelling type of AI and is basically a field of study that has focused on solving the problem of computers’ vision.

> Zuckerberg said, “If we are able to build computers that could understand what’s in an image and tell a blind person who otherwise couldn’t see that image, that would be pretty amazing as well.”

Computer vision is a subfield of AI that trains computer in understanding the visual world with the help of deep learning models to easily identify objects and then reacts accordingly.

**Computer Vision Project Idea –** Contours are outlines or the boundaries of the shape. You can build a project to detect certain types of shapes. **For example:** with a round shape, you can detect all the coins present in the image. The project is good to understand how to detect objects with different kinds of shapes.

### 4. Collage Mosaic Generator

![Top%2025%20Computer%20Vision%20Project%20Ideas%20for%202020%20Data%201/collage-mosaic-generator.jpg](Top%2025%20Computer%20Vision%20Project%20Ideas%20for%202020%20Data%201/collage-mosaic-generator.jpg)

**Computer Vision Project Idea –** A collage mosaic is an image that is made up of thousands of small images. To get a clear bigger picture composed of many small images it is required to position images properly according to the colors in the image. We can build an app that will generate a big collage mosaic comprising hundreds of images inside.

### 5. Panorama Stitching

**Computer Vision Project Idea –** Have you ever use the panorama mode in your smartphones? Once you dive into computer vision then you can build your own panorama app and it is very interesting to understand how panorama works.

### 6. Object Tracking with Camshift Algorithm

![Top%2025%20Computer%20Vision%20Project%20Ideas%20for%202020%20Data%201/computer-vision-project-face-detection.jpg](Top%2025%20Computer%20Vision%20Project%20Ideas%20for%202020%20Data%201/computer-vision-project-face-detection.jpg)

**Computer Vision Project Idea –** Face detection is a technique to find the location of the human faces in an image. Computers use various types of algorithms to detect if the shape in the image resembles a face or not. We can build an app to automatically detect faces and capture the image in our system.

### 2. Blur the Face

![Top%2025%20Computer%20Vision%20Project%20Ideas%20for%202020%20Data%201/blur-the-face.jpg](Top%2025%20Computer%20Vision%20Project%20Ideas%20for%202020%20Data%201/blur-the-face.jpg)

**Computer Vision Project Idea –** Blurring the face area of people from videos is done in all news channels and to hide the identity of a person. With computer vision, we can automatically detect the face region of the person and use it to blur the image. The project will be useful in blurring the faces of the people in the video.

### 3. Image Segmentation

### 5. Human Counting with OpenCV

![Top%2025%20Computer%20Vision%20Project%20Ideas%20for%202020%20Data%201/human-counting-with-opencv.jpg](Top%2025%20Computer%20Vision%20Project%20Ideas%20for%202020%20Data%201/human-counting-with-opencv.jpg)

**Computer Vision Project Idea –** A camera can be used to monitor and count the number of people present in the room, building, street, etc. First, we need to detect people and then we count their occurrence. It can be used to control the crowd.

### 6. Mobile Document Scanner

**Computer Vision Project Idea –** Document images taken from the camera can contain background, and their perspective is not aligned properly so we can build a document scanner app that will fix this by detecting the edges of the document and then transform the perspective.

### 7. Air Canvas

**Computer Vision Project Idea –** This is an interesting project in which you can draw anything by moving your hands in the air. The project will use a camera to detect the fingertip and then we can draw the shape on the canvas.

### 8. Colour Detection

![Top%2025%20Computer%20Vision%20Project%20Ideas%20for%202020%20Data%201/computer-vision-Project-color-detection.jpg](Top%2025%20Computer%20Vision%20Project%20Ideas%20for%202020%20Data%201/computer-vision-Project-color-detection.jpg)

**Computer Vision Project Idea –** Build a simple app that is responsible for detecting a particular color from the image. There are millions of different types of colors and we cannot name each of them. So we can use thousands of named colors to identify which color resembles close to the pixel from the image.

## Advanced Computer Vision Projects

### 1. Face Recognition

**Computer Vision Project Idea –** In a [face recognition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facial_recognition_system) app we not only detect if this is a face or not, we further recognize whose face is it. This is very useful in labelling people names and also authenticating using face. This project requires you to first feed data of the people you want to recognize and then we train the model that can recognize people.

### 2. Hand Gesture Recognition

**Computer Vision Project Idea –** In this project, we are going to determine the gesture of the hand in real-time using a webcam. First, the background is separated from the hand region and then the fingers are segmented to predict hand gesture. With different hand gestures, we can perform different actions.

### 3. Good Dog Capture

**Computer Vision Project Idea –** You know it’s hard to take a beautiful picture of your dog as they are restless and always moving. To solve this problem we can make a system that will capture the image of the dog when the dogs are smiling and looking directly at the camera.

### 4. Vehicle Counting and Classification

![Top%2025%20Computer%20Vision%20Project%20Ideas%20for%202020%20Data%201/Vehicle-counting-and-classification.jpg](Top%2025%20Computer%20Vision%20Project%20Ideas%20for%202020%20Data%201/Vehicle-counting-and-classification.jpg)

**Computer Vision Project Idea –** We can use the computer vision techniques to classify vehicles on the road, **HMV(heavy motor vehicle)** or **LMV( light motor vehicle)** and also count the number of vehicles that travel through a road. The data can be stored to analyze the different vehicles that travel from a road.

### 5. Data Augmentation Generator

**Computer Vision Project Idea –** To perform deep learning and machine learning we need lots of data which is hard to find. Data augmentation techniques are used a lot to increase the size of the dataset by performing rotations, transformations, zooming, flipping, etc. In this project, we can build an interface to select the augmentation method and then generate more data.

### 6. Selfie Capture when the User Smiles

**Computer Vision Project Idea –** Everyone loves a smiling picture, so how about making a camera app project which will capture images every time you smile. So for this, we need to build a model to identify whether a person is smiling or not.

### 7. Virtual Drums with OpenCV

**Computer Vision Project Idea –** The idea behind this project is to make a virtual drum that you can play by using a stick in the air. For this, the stick should be colored in the end that we will use to locate the position of stick and when it reaches a certain position a drum sound would be played. A challenge is to also measure the sound intensity based on the speed of the stick movement.

### 8. Image Reverse Search Engine

**Computer Vision Project Idea –** The computer vision techniques can be used to find images that are similar to the selected image. You need a database containing lots of images and then you can select an image to find similar images from the database.
