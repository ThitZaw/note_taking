**Here are some amazing and completely free resources online that you can use to teach yourself data science.**

Besides this page, I would highly recommend following the Quora [Data Science](https://www.quora.com/topic/Data-Science) topic if you haven't already to get updates on new questions and answers!

**Step 1. Fulfill your prerequisites**

Before you begin, you need Multivariable Calculus, Linear Algebra, and Python. If your math background is up to multivariable calculus and linear
algebra, you'll have enough background to understand almost all of the
probability / statistics / machine learning for the job.

- **Multivariate Calculus**: [What are the best resources for mastering multivariable calculus?](https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-best-resources-for-mastering-multivariable-calculus)
- **Numerical Linear Algebra / Computational Linear Algebra / Matrix Algebra:** [Linear Algebra](http://ocw.mit.edu/courses/mathematics/18-06-linear-algebra-spring-2010/), [Introduction to Linear Models and Matrix Algebra](https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-linear-models-matrix-harvardx-ph525-2x-0). Avoid linear algebra classes that are too theoretical, you need a linear algebra class that works with real matrices.

Multivariate calculus is useful for some parts of machine learning and a lot of
probability. Linear / Matrix algebra is absolutely necessary for a lot
of concepts in machine learning.

You also need some programming background to begin, preferably in Python.
Most other things on this guide can be learned on the job (like random
forests, pandas, A/B testing), but you can't get away without knowing
how to program!

**Python is the most important language for a data scientist to learn.** To learn to code, more about Python, and why Python is so important, check out

- [How do I learn to code?](https://www.quora.com/How-do-I-learn-to-code-1)
- [How do I learn Python?](https://www.quora.com/How-do-I-learn-Python-3)
- [Why is Python a language of choice for data scientists?](https://www.quora.com/Why-is-Python-a-language-of-choice-for-data-scientists)
- [Is Python the most important programming language to learn for aspiring data scientists and data miners?](https://www.quora.com/Is-Python-the-most-important-programming-language-to-learn-for-aspiring-data-scientists-and-data-miners)

R is the second most important language for a data scientist to learn.
I’m saying this as someone with a statistics background and who went
through undergrad mainly only using R. While R is powerful for dedicated statistical tasks, Python is more versatile as it will connect you more to production-level work.

If you're currently in school, **take statistics and computer science classes**. Check out [What classes should I take if I want to become a data scientist?](https://www.quora.com/What-classes-should-I-take-if-I-want-to-become-a-data-scientist)

**Step 2. Plug Yourself Into the Community**

Check out [Meetup](http://meetup.com/) to find some that interest you! Attend an interesting talk, learn about data science live, and meet data scientists and other aspirational data scientists. Start reading data science blogs and following influential
data scientists:

- [What are the best, insightful blogs about data, including how businesses are using data?](https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-best-insightful-blogs-about-data-including-how-businesses-are-using-data)
- [What is your source of machine learning and data science news? Why?](https://www.quora.com/What-is-your-source-of-machine-learning-and-data-science-news-Why)

- [What are the best Twitter accounts about data?](https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-best-Twitter-accounts-about-data)

**Step 3. Setup and Learn to use your tools**

**Python**

- Install Python, iPython, and related libraries ([guide](https://github.com/cs109/content/wiki/Installing-Python))
- [How do I learn Python?](https://www.quora.com/How-do-I-learn-Python-3)

**R**

- Install [R](http://www.r-project.org/) and [RStudio](http://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/) (It's good to know both Python and R)
- Learn R with [swirl](http://swirlstats.com/)

**Sublime Text**

- Install [Sublime Text](http://www.sublimetext.com/)
- [What's the best way to learn to use Sublime Text?](https://www.quora.com/Whats-the-best-way-to-learn-to-use-Sublime-Text)

**SQL**

- [How do I learn SQL? What are some good online resources, like websites, blogs, or videos?](https://www.quora.com/How-do-I-learn-SQL-What-are-some-good-online-resources-like-websites-blogs-or-videos) (You can practice it using the sqlite package in Python)

**Step 4. Learn Probability and Statistics**

Be sure to go through a course that involves heavy application in R or
Python. Knowing probability and statistics will only really be helpful
if you can implement what you learn.

- **Python Application:** [Think Stats](http://greenteapress.com/thinkstats/) ([free pdf](http://greenteapress.com/thinkstats/thinkstats.pdf)) (Python focus)
- **R Applications:** [An Introduction to Statistical Learning](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1461471370) ([free pdf](http://free pdf))([MOOC](https://class.stanford.edu/courses/HumanitiesScience/StatLearning/Winter2014/about)) (R focus)
- Print out a copy of [Probability Cheatsheet](http://www.wzchen.com/probability-cheatsheet/)

**Step 5. Complete Harvard's Data Science Course**

[https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-52f4f5929d90d4fd49973838656197a4](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-52f4f5929d90d4fd49973838656197a4)

As of Fall 2015, the course is currently in its third year and strives to
be as applicable and helpful as possible for students who are interested in becoming data scientists. An example of how is this happening is the introduction of Spark and SQL starting this year.

I'd recommend doing the **labs and lectures from 2015** and the **homeworks from 2013** (2015 homeworks are not available to the public, and the 2014 homeworks are
written under a different instructor than the original instructors).

This course is developed in part by a fellow Quora user, Professor ****[Joe Blitzstein](https://www.quora.com/profile/Joe-Blitzstein). Here are all of the materials!

**Step 6. Do all of Kaggle's Getting Started and Playground Competitions**

I would NOT recommend doing any of the prize-money competitions. They
usually have datasets that are too large, complicated, or annoying, and
are not good for learning. The competitions are available at [Competitions | Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions)

Start by learning scikit-learn, playing around, reading through tutorials and forums on the competitions that you’re doing. Next, play around some
more and check out the tutorials for [Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic) for a **binary classification** task (with categorical variables, missing values, etc.)

Afterwards, try some **multi-class classification** with [Forest Cover Type Prediction](https://www.kaggle.com/c/forest-cover-type-prediction). Now, try a **regression** task [House Prices: Advanced Regression Techniques](https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques). Try out some **natural language processing** with [Quora Question Pairs | Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/quora-question-pairs). Finally, try out any of the other knowledge-based competitions that interest you!

**Step 7. Learn Some Data Science Electives**

Data science is an incredibly large and interdisciplinary field, and
different jobs will require different skillsets. Here are some of the
more common ones:

- **Product Metrics** will teach you about what companies track, what metrics they find important, and how companies measure their success: [The 27 Metrics in Pinterest’s Internal Growth Dashboard](http://jwegan.com/growth-hacking/27-metrics-pinterests-internal-growth-dashboard/)
- **Machine Learning** [How do I learn machine learning?](https://www.quora.com/How-do-I-learn-machine-learning-1) This is an extremely rich area with massive amounts of potential, and
likely the “sexiest” area of data science today. Andrew Ng's Machine
Learning course on Coursera is one of the most popular MOOCs, and a
great way to start! [Andrew Ng's Machine Learning MOOC](https://www.coursera.org/course/ml)
- **A/B Testing** is incredibly important to help inform product decisions for consumer applications. Learn more about A/B testing here: [How do I learn about A/B testing?](https://www.quora.com/How-do-I-learn-about-A-B-testing)
- **Visualization** - I would recommend picking up ggplot2 in R to make simple yet beautiful graphics and just browsing [DataIsBeautiful • /r/dataisbeautiful](http://www.reddit.com/r/dataisbeautiful) and [FlowingData](http://flowingdata.com/) for ideas and inspiration.
- **User Behavior -** This set of blogs posts looks useful and interesting - [This Explains Everything " User Behavior](http://www.productpsychology.com/category/user-behavior/)
- **Feature Engineering -** Check out [What are some best practices in Feature Engineering?](https://www.quora.com/What-are-some-best-practices-in-Feature-Engineering) and this great example: [http://nbviewer.ipython.org/gith...](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/aguschin/kaggle/blob/master/forestCoverType_featuresEngineering.ipynb)
- **Big Data Technologies** - These are tools and frameworks developed specifically to deal with massive amounts of data. [How do I learn big data technologies?](https://www.quora.com/How-do-I-learn-big-data-technologies-1)
- **Optimization** will help you with understanding statistics and machine learning: [Convex Optimization - Boyd and Vandenberghe](http://stanford.edu/~boyd/cvxbook/)
- **Natural Language Processing** - This is the practice of turning text data into numerical data whilst
still preserving the "meaning". Learning this will let you analyze new,
exciting forms of data. [How do I learn Natural Language Processing (NLP)?](https://www.quora.com/How-do-I-learn-Natural-Language-Processing-NLP)
- **Time Series Analysis -** [How do I learn about time series analysis?](https://www.quora.com/How-do-I-learn-about-time-series-analysis-1)

**Step 8. Do a Capstone Product / Side Project**

Use your new data science and software engineering skills to build
something that will make other people say wow! This can be a website,
new way of looking at a dataset, cool visualization, or anything!

**Step 10. Share your Wisdom Back with the Data Science Community**

If you’ve made it this far, congratulations on becoming a data scientist!
I’d encourage you to share your knowledge and what you’ve learned back
with the data science community. Data Science as a nascent field depends on knowledge-sharing!

---

**Think like a Data Scientist**

In addition to the concrete steps I listed above to develop the skill set of a data scientist, I include **seven challenges** below so you can learn to **think like a data scientist** and develop the right attitude to become one.

**(1) Satiate your curiosity through data**

**As a data scientist you write your own questions and answers.** Data scientists are naturally curious about the data that they're looking
at, and are creative with ways to approach and solve whatever problem
needs to be solved.

**Much of data science is not the analysis itself, but discovering an interesting question and figuring out how to answer it.**

Here are two great examples:

- [Hilary: the most poisoned baby name in US history](http://hilaryparker.com/2013/01/30/hilary-the-most-poisoned-baby-name-in-us-history/)
- [A Look at Fire Response Data](http://blog.stevewhardin.com/2014/03/17/a-look-at-fire-response-data/)

**Challenge**: Think of a problem or topic you're interested in and answer it with data!

**(2) Read news with a skeptical eye**

Much of the contribution of a data scientist (and why it's really hard to
replace a data scientist with a machine), is that a data scientist will
tell you what's important and what's spurious. This persistent
skepticism is healthy in all sciences, and is especially necessarily in a fast-paced environment where it's too easy to let a spurious result be
misinterpreted.

You can adopt this mindset yourself by reading news with a critical eye. **Many news articles have inherently flawed main premises.** Try these two articles. Sample answers are available in the comments.

Easier: [You Love Your iPhone. Literally.](http://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/01/opinion/you-love-your-iphone-literally.html?_r=0)

Harder: [Who predicted Russia’s military intervention?](http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/monkey-cage/wp/2014/03/12/who-predicted-russias-military-intervention-2/)

**Challenge:** Do this every day when you encounter a news article. Comment on the article and point out the flaws.

**(3) See data as a tool to improve consumer products**

Visit a consumer internet product (probably that you know doesn't do
extensive A/B testing already), and then think about their main funnel.
Do they have a checkout funnel? Do they have a signup funnel? Do they
have a virility mechanism? Do they have an engagement funnel?

Go through the funnel multiple times and hypothesize about different ways
it could do better to increase a core metric (conversion rate, shares,
signups, etc.). Design an experiment to verify if your suggested change
can actually change the core metric.

**Challenge**: Share it with the feedback email for the consumer internet site!

**(4) Think like a Bayesian**

To think like a Bayesian, avoid the [Base rate fallacy](http://www.wikiwand.com/en/Base_rate_fallacy). This means to form new beliefs you must incorporate both newly observed information AND prior information formed through intuition and
experience.

**Checking your dashboard, user engagement numbers are significantly down today. Which of the following is most likely?**

1. Users are suddenly less engaged2. Feature of site broke3. Logging feature broke

Even though explanation #1 completely explains the drop, #2 and #3 should be more likely because they have a much higher prior probability.

**You're in senior management at Tesla, and five of Tesla's Model S's have
caught fire in the last five months. Which is more likely?**

1. Manufacturing quality has decreased and Teslas should now be deemed unsafe.2. Safety has not changed and fires in Tesla Model S's are still much rarer than their counterparts in gasoline cars.

While #1 is an easy explanation (and great for media coverage), your prior
should be strong on #2 because of your regular quality testing. However, you should still be seeking information that can update your beliefs on #1 versus #2 (and still find ways to improve safety). Question for thought: what information should you seek?

**Challenge:** Identify the last time you committed the Base Rate Fallacy. Avoid committing the fallacy from now on.

**(5) Know the limitations of your tools**

> “Knowledge is knowing that a tomato is a fruit, wisdom is not putting it in a fruit salad.” - Miles Kington

Knowledge is knowing how to perform a ordinary linear regression, wisdom is realizing how rare it applies cleanly in practice.

Knowledge is knowing five different variations of K-means clustering, wisdom is
realizing how rarely actual data can be cleanly clustered, and how
poorly K-means clustering can work with too many features.

Knowledge is knowing a vast range of sophisticated techniques, but wisdom is
being able to choose the one that will provide the most amount of impact for the company in a reasonable amount of time.

You may develop a vast range of tools while you go through your Coursera or EdX courses, but **your toolbox is not useful until you know which tools to use.**

**Challenge:** Apply several tools to a real dataset and discover the tradeoffs and
limitations of each tools. Which tools worked best, and can you figure
out why?

**(6) Teach a complicated concept**

How does Richard Feynman distinguish which concepts he understands and which concepts he doesn't?

> Feynman
 was a truly great teacher. He prided himself on being able to devise 
ways to explain even the most profound ideas to beginning students. 
Once, I said to him, "Dick, explain to me, so that I can understand it, 
why spin one-half particles obey Fermi-Dirac statistics." Sizing up his 
audience perfectly, Feynman said, "I'll prepare a freshman lecture on 
it." But he came back a few days later to say, "I couldn't do it. I 
couldn't reduce it to the freshman level. That means we don't really 
understand it." - David L. Goodstein, Feynman's Lost Lecture: The Motion of Planets Around the Sun

What distinguished Richard Feynman was his ability to distill complex
concepts into comprehendible ideas. Similarly, what distinguishes top
data scientists is their ability to cogently share their ideas and
explain their analyses.

Check out [https://www.quora.com/Edwin-Chen...](https://www.quora.com/Edwin-Chen-1/answers) for examples of cogently-explained technical concepts.

**Challenge:** Teach a technical concept to a friend or on a public forum, like Quora or YouTube.

**(7) Convince others about what's important**

Perhaps even more important than a data scientist's ability to explain their analysis is their ability to **communicate the value and potential impact of the actionable insights.**

**Certain tasks of data science will be commoditized as data science tools become better and better.** New tools will make obsolete certain tasks such as writing dashboards,
unnecessary data wrangling, and even specific kinds of predictive
modeling.

**However, the need for a data scientist to extract out and communicate what's important** will never be made obsolete. With increasing amounts of data and
potential insights, companies will always need data scientists (or
people in data science-like roles), to triage all that can be done and
prioritize tasks based on impact.

The data scientist's role in the company is the **serve as the ambassador between the data and the company**. The success of a data scientist is measured by how well he/she can tell a story and make an impact. Every other skill is amplified by this
ability.

**Challenge:** Tell a story with statistics. Communicate the important findings in a
dataset. Make a convincing presentation that your audience cares about.

Good luck and best wishes on your journey to becoming a data scientist! For more resources check out Quora’s official [Quora Data Science FAQ](https://www.quora.com/topic/Data-Science/faq)
